                I specialize in React JS, and have a great understanding of the fundamentals of web dev - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also have experience working with Firebase databases.<br></br><br></br>
                My background is in fitness; I have been in the industry as a trainer for 7+ years, and am looking to hopefully bridge the gap between the physical and technological. I believe there is huge potential in using tech to better our understanding of our own health & fitness.</p>
